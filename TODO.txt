With replacing NaNs: 0.00646
Without replacing NaNs: 0.00577
My guess: null hypothesis

TODO:

3.	a) check that validation period is in fact 7 days
	b) check that submissions do not have duplicate entries for a given user
	c) find bottleneck in code
	d) use a grid search to find the best set of hyper parameters for EACH user; 
		then take the mean of this dataset as final weights;
		or use a regression model to find weights that maximize the MAP score
4. add code for weighing each similarity score on
	a) user coupons
	b) user visited coupons
	c) coupons derived from similar users
5. how to use machine learning in collaborative filtering / user-user comparisons?
6. optimize hyperparameters:
	numerical variable weights, 
	weights for user coupon purchases by time, 
	different similarity functions,
	including visit/similar user parameters,
	etc
7. look at netflix prize solution
