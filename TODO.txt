2. plot histogram of user purchases over time
3. implement architecture for cross validation (including MAP function)
4. create better model for User.num_coupons() (markov process?)
5. optimize hyperparameters: 
	User.num_coupons(), 
	numerical variable weights, 
	weights for user coupon purchases by time, 
	different similarity functions,
	etc
6. start thinking about collaborative filtering
