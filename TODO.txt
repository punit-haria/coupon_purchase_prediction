With replacing NaNs: 0.00646
Without replacing NaNs: 0.00577
My guess: null hypothesis

Validation:

- check that submissions do not have duplicate entries for a given user

TODO:

3.	d) use a grid search to find the best set of hyper parameters for EACH user;
		then take the mean of this dataset as final weights;
		or use a regression model to find weights that maximize the MAP score
	e) calculate Coverage metric for model (Item space and User space coverage)
4. add code for weighing each similarity score on
	a) user coupons
	b) user visited coupons
	c) coupons derived from similar users
5. optimize hyperparameters:
	numerical variable weights, 
	weights for user coupon purchases by time, 
	different similarity functions,
	including visit/similar user parameters,
	etc
6. look at netflix prize solution
