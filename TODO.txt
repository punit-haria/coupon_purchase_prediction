Notes:

With replacing NaNs: 0.00646
Without replacing NaNs: 0.00577
My guess: null hypothesis (i.e. no difference)

Validation:

- check that submissions do not have duplicate entries for a given user

Questions:

- is purchased list a subset of visited list?
	No it isn't. This needs further investigation.
- how does the distribution of #purchased compare with the distribution of #visited?
	Visitations are larger as expected.

3. Create separate Models in code for:
	- purchased coupon model
	- visited coupon model
	- similar users' coupons model
	- user behaviour model (activity level of user, etc.)
	- coupon behaviour model (popularity of coupon, etc.)
	Then, use model averaging along with compare_MAP function in R to build an ensemble.
5. Calculate Coverage metric for model (Item space and User space coverage)
