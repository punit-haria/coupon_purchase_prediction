Notes:

With replacing NaNs: 0.00646
Without replacing NaNs: 0.00577
My guess: null hypothesis (i.e. no difference)

Validation:

- check that submissions do not have duplicate entries for a given user

Questions:

- is purchased list a subset of visited list?
	No it isn't. This needs further investigation.
- how does the distribution of #purchased compare with the distribution of #visited?
	Visitations are larger as expected.


TODO:

3. Add code to take the Average Precisions of all Users and store them
	- later we can compare AP of users across models
4. Add code for weighing each similarity score on
	a) user coupons
	b) user visited coupons
	c) recent coupons vs. old coupons (purchased date?, release date?, expire date?)
	d) coupons derived from similar users
5. Calculate Coverage metric for model (Item space and User space coverage)
6. Expand the MAP score metric in the code so that we can see which users were predicted correctly
	and which ones were predicted wrong. This will be useful when comparing models.
7. Optimize hyperparameters:
	numerical variable weights, 
	weights for user coupon purchases by time, 
	different similarity functions,
	including visit/similar user parameters,
	etc
